SO now what we have done 
1. we have our folder src 
    - in which we have a build a new folder MODELS
        - which will contain all the mongoose model of our app that is task and user
    - we have build a index,js file 
        - which will act like  the main file to build a post request from POSTMAN and serve it to the ROBO 3T 
2. mongodb.js is just for practice
3. mongoose.js will connect with index.js and serve the models
4. we have used express framework
